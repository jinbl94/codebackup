 A pervasive “narrow waist” (not limited to
		 the host-based communication as in the
		 current Internet) for all key functions,
 including access to principals, interaction
 among stakeholders, and trust manage-
 ment; it aims to provide interoperability at
 all levels in the system, not just packet for-
 warding.
 The XIA components and their interactions
 are illustrated in Fig. 4. The core of the XIA is
 the Expressive Internet Protocol (XIP) support-
 ing communication between various types of
 principals. Three typical XIA principal types are-
 content, host (defined by “who”), and service
 (defined by what it does). They are open to
 future extension. Each type of principal has a
 narrow waist that defines the minimal function-
 ality required for interoperability. Principles talk
 to each other using expressive identifiers (XIDs),
 which are 160 bit identifiers identifying hosts,
 pieces of content, or services. The XIDs are
 basically self-certifying identifiers taking advan-
 tage of cryptographic hash technology. By using
 this XID, the content retrieval no longer relies
 on a particular host, service or network path.
 XIP can then support future functions as a
 diverse set of services. For low-level services, it
 uses a path-segment-based network architecture
 (named Tapa in their previous work) as the
 basic building block; and builds services for con-
 tent-transfer and caching and service for secure
 content provenance at a higher level. XIA also
 needs various trustworthy mechanisms and pro-
 vides network availability even when under
 attack. Finally, XIA defines explicit interfaces
 between network actors with different roles and
 goals.
 G LOBAL E NVIRONMENT FOR
 N ETWORK I NNOVATIONS (GENI)
	GENI [7] is a collaborative program supported
	by NSF aimed at providing a global large-scale
	experimental testbed for future Internet archi-
	tecture test and validation. Started in 2005, it
	has attracted broad interest and participation
	from both academia and industry. Besides its ini-
	tial support from existing projects on a dedicated
	backbone network infrastructure, it also aims to
	attract other infrastructure platforms to partici-
	pate in the federation — the device control
	framework to provide these participating net-
	works with users and operating environments, to
	observe, measure, and record the resulting exper-
	imental outcomes. So generally, GENI is differ-
	30
	ent from common testbeds in that it is a general-
	purpose large-scale facility that puts no limits on
	the network architectures, services, and applica-
	tions to be evaluated; it aims to allow clean-slate
	designs to experiment with real users under real
	conditions.
	The key idea of GENI is to build multiple
	virtualized slices out of the substrate for resource
	sharing and experiments. It contains two key
	pieces:
	• Physical network substrates that are expand-
	able building block components
	• A global control and management frame-
	work that assembles the building blocks
	together into a coherent facility
	Thus, intuitively two kinds of activities will be
	involved in GENI testbeds: one is deploying a
	prototype testbed federating different small and
	medium ones together (e.g., the OpenFlow
			testbed for campus networks [8]); the other is to
	run observable, controllable, and recordable
	experiments on it.
	There are several working groups concentrat-
	ing on different areas, such as the control frame-
	work working group; GENI experiment workflow
	and service working group; campus/operation,
	management, integration, and security working
	group; and instrumentation and management
	working group.
	The GENI generic control framework con-
	sists of several subsystems and corresponding
	basic entities:
	• Aggregate and components
	• Clearinghouse
	• Research
	organizations,
	including
	researchers and experiment tools
	• Experiment support service
	• “Opt-in” end users
	• GENI operation and management
	Clearinghouses from different organizations and
	places (e.g., those from the United States and
			European Union) can be connected through fed-
	eration. By doing this, GENI not only federates
	with identical “GENI-like” systems, but also with
	any other system if they comply with a clearly
	defined and relatively narrow set of interfaces
	for federation. With these entities and subsys-
	tems, “slices” can be created on top of the
	shared substrate for miscellaneous research-
	defined specific experiments, and end users can
	“opt in” onto the GENI testbed accordingly.
	GENI’s research and implementation plan
	consists of multiple continuous spirals (currently
			in spiral 3). Each spiral lasts for 12 months. Spi-
	ral 1 ran from 2008 to 2009; spiral 2 ran from
	2009 to 2010; spiral 3 started in 2011. In spiral 1,
	the primary goals were to demonstrate one or
	more early prototypes of the GENI control
	framework and end-to-end slice operation across
	multiple technologies; there were five competing
	approaches to the GENI control framework,
	called “clusters.”
	Cluster A was the Trial Integration Environ-ment based on DETER (TIED) control frame-
	work focusing on federation, trust, and security.
	It was a one-project cluster based on the Cyber-
	Defense Technology Experimental Research
	(DETER) control framework by the University
	of Southern California (USC)/ISI, which is an
	individual “mini-GENI” testbed to demonstratefederated and coordinated network provisioning.
	Cluster A particularly aimed to provide usability
	across multiple communities through federation.
	The project delivered software “fedd” as the
	implementation of the TIED federation archi-
	tecture providing dynamic and on-demand feder-
	ation, and interoperability across ProtoGENI,
	GENIAPI, and non-GENI aggregate. It included
	an Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)
	mechanism for large-scale distributed systems. It
	created a federation with two other projects:
	StarBED in Japan and ProtoGENI in the Unit-
	ed States.
	Cluster B was a control framework based on
	PlanetLab implemented by Princeton University
	emphasizing experiments with virtualized
	machines over the Internet. By the end of spiral
	2, it included at least 12 projects from different
	universities and research institutes. The results
	of these projects are to be integrated into the
	PlanetLab testbed. PlanetLab provided “GENI-
	wrapper” code for independent development of
	an aggregate manager (AM) for Internet enti-
	ties. A special “lightweight” protocol was intro-
	duced to interface PlanetLab and OpenFlow
	equipment. Through these mechanisms, other
	projects in the cluster can design their own sub-
	strates and component managers with different
	capacities and features.
	Cluster C was the ProtoGENI control frame-
	work by the University of Utah based on Emu-
	lab, emphasizing network control and
	management. By the end of spiral 2, it consisted
	of at least 20 projects. The cluster integrated
	these existing and under-construction systems to
	provide key GENI functions. The integration
	included four key components: a backbone based
	on Internet2; sliceable and programmable PCs
	and NetFPGA cards; and subnets of wireless
	and wired edge clusters. Cluster C so far is the
	largest set of integrated projects in GENI.
	Cluster D was Open Resource Control Archi-
	tecture (ORCA) from Duke University and
	RENCI focusing on resource allocation and
	integration of sensor networks. By the end of
	spiral 2, it consisted of five projects. ORCA tried
	to include optical resources from the existing
	Metro-Scale Optical Testbed (BEN). Different
	from other clusters, the ORCA implementation
	included the integration of wireless/sensor proto-
	types. It maintains a clearinghouse for the
	testbeds under the ORCA control framework
	through which it connects to the national back-
	bone and is available to external researchers.
	Cluster E was Open-Access Research Testbed
	for Next-Generation Wireless Networks
	(ORBIT) by Rutgers University focusing on
	mobile and wireless testbed networks. It includ-
	ed three projects by the end of spiral 2. The
	basic ORBIT did not include a full clearing-
	house implementation. Cluster E tried to
	research how mobile and wireless work can
	affect and possibly be merged into the GENI
	architecture. WiMAX is one of the wireless net-
	work prototypes in this cluster.
	A more detailed description of the clusters
	and their specific approaches and corresponding
	features can be found in our previous survey
	[18]. Even more details can be found from GENI
	project websites and wikis [7].
	Figure 4. XIA components and interactions.
	We can see that spirals 1 and 2 integrated a
	very wide variety of testbeds into its control
	framework. Spiral 2 was the second phase aim-
	ing to move toward continuous experimentation.
	Key developments include improved integration
	of GENI prototypes; architecture, tools, and ser-
	vices enabling experiment instrumentation; inter-
	operability across GENI prototypes; and
	researcher identity management. In spiral 3, the
	goal is to coordinate the design and deployment
	of a first GENI Instrumentation and Measure-
	ment Architecture. Supporting experimental use
	of GENI and making it easier to use are also key
	goals. Also, more backbone services and partici-
	pants are expected to join in the GENI frame-
	work for this spiral.
	Another notable and unique characteristic
	offered by GENI is that instrumentation and
	measurement support have been designed into
	the system from the beginning since the ultimate
	goal of GENI is to provide an open and extensi-
	ble testbed for experimentation with various new
	Internet architectures.
